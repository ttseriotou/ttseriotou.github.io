I am Talia, a third year PhD student at the [Computational Linguistics Lab](https://compling.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) of Queen Mary University of London, supervised by Prof. Maria Liakata and previously by Dr Adam Tsakalidis. I am funded by the DeepMind PhD Scholarship.

My research interests lie on representation learning, temporality, memory-augmented models, personalised LLMs and aligning language models with human preferences. I recently completed an internship as a Research Intern at Huawei Technologies Research & Development (UK).

Before my doctoral studies I worked for 4.5 years in the industry as a Senior AI Data Scientist leading AI projects and building Machine Learning and NLP models for production-level applications. Specifically I worked for [Chubb Insurance](https://about.chubb.com/) under the supervision of Chris Glaze in New York, Singapore and London and for Media Assembly in New York. I hold an MS in Applied Mathematics from Columbia University and a BA/MEng in Chemical Engineering from University of Cambridge.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, traveling, occusional spinning and yoga classes and quality time with friends and family.
